**Internationalization** is the process of designing an application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.


**HATEOAS** is a constraint on REST that says that a client of a REST application 
need only know a single fixed URL to access it. Any and all resources should be discoverable 
dynamically from that URL through hyperlinks included in the representations of returned resources


Generally, resources can have multiple presentations, mostly because there may be multiple different clients expecting different representations. Asking for a suitable presentation by a client, is referred as **content negotiation**.
